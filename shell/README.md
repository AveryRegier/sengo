# Sengo Shell

This package provides an interactive shell for the Sengo MongoDB-like client.

## Usage

To start the shell from the monorepo root:

```sh
npm start
```

Or from within the shell directory:

```sh
npm start
```

The shell supports commands like:
- `connect <repositoryType>`: Connect to a Sengo client backend (e.g., `memory`, `s3`)
- `close`: Close the current client

See the main README for monorepo setup and build instructions.
