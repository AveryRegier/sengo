This project is a TypeScript Node.js library called 'sengo'. It is an open source clean room implementation of a useful subset of the MongoDB client for Node.js, using AWS S3 as a backend for document storage.

- Focus on MongoDB-like API design for document operations.
- Use AWS SDK for S3 interactions.
- Ensure all code is original and does not copy MongoDB source.
- Prioritize clean, readable, and well-documented TypeScript code.
